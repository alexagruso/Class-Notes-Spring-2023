    abstract = "{This chapter is the most formidable in the book, but it provides a deep and complete understanding of the classic Shor factoring algorithm. Alice and Bob set the context for the algorithm by explaining how the difficulty of factoring large numbers plays a critical role in securing encrypted communications channels, using RSA encryption as an example. The Shor algorithm, if implemented on a sufficiently large quantum computer, could defeat those encryption schemes by finding those factors relatively quickly, a task that would take years or more on even the fastest classical supercomputers. Alice and Bob lead us through some number theory to establish the connection between factoring and finding the period of a periodic function. They then show how the clever use of quantum algorithms—this is Shor’s main contribution—leads to a fast way to find the required period using quantum Fourier transforms.}",

abstract = {An encryption method is presented with the novel property that publicly revealing an encryption key does not thereby reveal the corresponding decryption key. This has two important consequences: (1) Couriers or other secure means are not needed to transmit keys, since a message can be enciphered using an encryption key publicly revealed by the intented recipient. Only he can decipher the message, since only he knows the corresponding decryption key. (2) A message can be “signed” using a privately held decryption key. Anyone can verify this signature using the corresponding publicly revealed encryption key. Signatures cannot be forged, and a signer cannot later deny the validity of his signature. This has obvious applications in “electronic mail” and “electronic funds transfer” systems. A message is encrypted by representing it as a number M, raising M to a publicly specified power e, and then taking the remainder when the result is divided by the publicly specified product, n, of two large secret primer numbers p and q. Decryption is similar; only a different, secret, power d is used, where e * d ≡ 1(mod (p - 1) * (q - 1)). The security of the system rests in part on the difficulty of factoring the published divisor, n.},

With the current bounds for infeasible attack, it appears to be about 20{\%} faster than the Diffie-Hellmann scheme over GF(p). As computational power grows, this disparity should get rapidly bigger.",
