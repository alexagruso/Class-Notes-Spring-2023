    abstract = "{This chapter is the most formidable in the book, but it provides a deep and complete understanding of the classic Shor factoring algorithm. Alice and Bob set the context for the algorithm by explaining how the difficulty of factoring large numbers plays a critical role in securing encrypted communications channels, using RSA encryption as an example. The Shor algorithm, if implemented on a sufficiently large quantum computer, could defeat those encryption schemes by finding those factors relatively quickly, a task that would take years or more on even the fastest classical supercomputers. Alice and Bob lead us through some number theory to establish the connection between factoring and finding the period of a periodic function. They then show how the clever use of quantum algorithms—this is Shor’s main contribution—leads to a fast way to find the required period using quantum Fourier transforms.}",
