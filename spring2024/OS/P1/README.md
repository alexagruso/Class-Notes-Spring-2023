# How to run the simulation

First, ensure the run script `run.sh` is executable by running `chmod +x run.sh`.

Next, simply execute `./run.sh`. This will execute the program with arrival rates from 1 to 30 and output the results into `output.csv`.

# Individual run

To execute the simulation once, run `make`, then `./simulation <params...>`.

Run `./simulation --help` for more options.
