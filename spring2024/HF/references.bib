  Abstract = {Although many studies have investigated how well government
              websites have implemented website accessibility standards, such as
              Section 508 and WCAG 2.0, very little research has been conducted
              exploring what factors influence the level of implementation. Based
              on the organizational innovation model proposed by Frances Berry,
              this study examines 342 county government websites in the USA and
              analyzes how several factors, such as budget resources, local
              demographics and forms of county government, influence the
              accessibility of the sites. The result of the OLS estimate
              indicates that the complexity of the websites and the county
              population density are the most important predictors of web
              accessibility. County budget is also a marginal predictor, while
              the percentage of the population with disabilities is a negative
              predictor. Given the slow progress in the implementation of higher
              accessibility standards in the USA, the findings of this study
              provide timely implications for policymakers },
